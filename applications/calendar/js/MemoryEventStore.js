/*
 * This is a simple in-memory store implementation that is ONLY intended for use with
 * calendar samples running locally in the browser with no external data source. Under
 * normal circumstances, stores that use a MemoryProxy are read-only and intended only
 * for displaying data read from memory. In the case of the calendar, it's still quite
 * useful to be able to deal with in-memory data for sample purposes (as many people 
 * may not have PHP set up to run locally), but by default, updates will not work since the
 * calendar fully expects all CRUD operations to be supported by the store (and in fact
 * will break, for example, if phantom records are not removed properly). This simple
 * class gives us a convenient way of loading and updating calendar event data in memory,
 * but should NOT be used outside of the local samples. 
 * 
 * For a real-world store implementation see the remote sample (remote.js).
